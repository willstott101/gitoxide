## Makes the crate execute as fast as possible by supporting parallel computation of otherwise long-running functions
## as well as fast, hardware accelerated hashing, along with a faster zlib backend.
## If disabled, the binary will be visibly smaller.
fast = ["gix/max-performance"]

## Use `clap` 3.0 to build the prettiest, best documented and most user-friendly CLI at the expense of binary size.
## Provides a terminal user interface for detailed and exhaustive progress.
## Provides a line renderer for leaner progress display, without the need for a full-blown TUI.

## The `--verbose` flag will be powered by an interactive progress mechanism that doubles as log as well as interactive progress
## that appears after a short duration.

## Due to async client-networking not being implemented for most transports, this one supports only the 'git' transport.
## It uses, however, a fully asynchronous networking implementation which can serve a real-world example on how to implement custom async transports.
lean-async = ["fast", "pretty-cli", "gitoxide-core-tools", "gitoxide-core-tools-query", "gitoxide-core-async-client", "prodash-render-line"]

## As small as it can possibly be, no threading, no fast sha1, line progress only, rust based zlib implementation.
## no networking, local operations only.
small = ["pretty-cli", "gix-features/rustsha1", "gix-features/zlib-rust-backend", "prodash-render-line", "is-terminal"  ]

## Makes the crate execute as fast as possible without pulling in C libraries, while keeping everything else minimal akin to the `small` build.

##  A way to enable all `gitoxide-core` tools found in `gix tools`

## A program to perform analytics on a git repository, using an auto-maintained sqlite database
gitoxide-core-tools-query = ["gitoxide-core-tools", "gitoxide-core/query"]

#! #### Mutually Exclusive Networking
#! If both are set a compile error is triggered. This also means that `cargo â€¦ --all-features` will fail.

## Use blocking client networking.
