//! The tree of supported configuration values for use in [`config_overrides`][crate::open::Options::config_overrides()]
//! or for validating and transforming well-known configuration values.
//!
//! It can also be used to traverse all implemented keys and to validate values before usage as configuration overrides.
//!
//! ### Leniency
//!
//! When validating values, we don't apply leniency here which is left to the caller. Leniency is an application defined configuration
//! to ignore errors on non-security related values, which might make applications more resilient towards misconfiguration.
