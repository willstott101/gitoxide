//! This crate provides the [`Repository`] abstraction which serves as a hub into all the functionality of git.
//!
//! It's powerful and won't sacrifice performance while still increasing convenience compared to using the sub-crates
//! individually. Sometimes it may hide complexity under the assumption that the performance difference doesn't matter
//! for all but the fewest tools out there, which would be using the underlying crates directly or file an issue.
//!
//! # The prelude and extensions
//!
//! With `use git_repository::prelude::*` you should be ready to go as it pulls in various extension traits to make functionality
//! available on objects that may use it.
//!
//! The method signatures are still complex and may require various arguments for configuration and cache control.
//!
//! Most extensions to existing objects provide an `obj_with_extension.attach(&repo).an_easier_version_of_a_method()` for simpler
//! call signatures.
//!
//! ## ThreadSafe Mode
//!
//! By default, the [`Repository`] isn't `Sync` and thus can't be used in certain contexts which require the `Sync` trait.
//!
//! To help with this, convert it with [`.into_sync()`][Repository::into_sync()] into a [`ThreadSafeRepository`].
//!
//! ## Object-Access Performance
//!
//! Accessing objects quickly is the bread-and-butter of working with git, right after accessing references. Hence it's vital
//! to understand which cache levels exist and how to leverage them.
//!
//! When accessing an object, the first cache that's queried is a  memory-capped LRU object cache, mapping their id to data and kind.
//! It has to be specifically enabled a [`Repository`].
//! On miss, the object is looked up and if a pack is hit, there is a small fixed-size cache for delta-base objects.
//!
//! In scenarios where the same objects are accessed multiple times, the object cache can be useful and is to be configured specifically
//! using the [`object_cache_size(â€¦)`][crate::Repository::object_cache_size()] method.
//!
//! Use the `cache-efficiency-debug` cargo feature to learn how efficient the cache actually is - it's easy to end up with lowered
//! performance if the cache is not hit in 50% of the time.
//!
//! ### Terminology
//!
//! #### WorkingTree and WorkTree
//!
//! When reading the documentation of the canonical gix-worktree program one gets the impression work tree and working tree are used
//! interchangeably. We use the term _work tree_ only and try to do so consistently as its shorter and assumed to be the same.
//!
//! # Cargo-features
//!
//! To make using  _sub-crates_ easier these are re-exported into the root of this crate. Here we list how to access nested plumbing
//! crates which are otherwise harder to discover:
//!
//! **`git_repository::`**
//! * [`odb`]
//!   * [`pack`][odb::pack]
//! * [`protocol`]
//!   * [`transport`][protocol::transport]
//!     * [`packetline`][protocol::transport::packetline]
//!
//!
//! ## Feature Flags
#![cfg_attr(
    feature = "document-features",
    cfg_attr(doc, doc = ::document_features::document_features!())
)]
#![cfg_attr(docsrs, feature(doc_cfg, doc_auto_cfg))]
#![deny(missing_docs, rust_2018_idioms, unsafe_code)]

// Re-exports to make this a potential one-stop shop crate avoiding people from having to reference various crates themselves.
// This also means that their major version changes affect our major version, but that's alright as we directly expose their
// APIs/instances anyway.
