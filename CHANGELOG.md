# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

This release also fixes compatibility issues that formerly prevented to fetch or clone form `https://googlesource.com`.

### Changed

 - <csr-id-a4ac9cf3e667a3059e33aac8188150529578622d/> represent `GIT_(COMMITTER|AUTHOR)_(NAME|EMAIL|DATE)` with git configuration.
   That way it becomes more obvious where values are coming from.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-98143699bb9481b010e21647f64dcb8a74bd80ad/> auto-enabled verbosity for `gix fetch/clone` and add `--no-verbose`.
   I found myself always adding (and having to remember to add) the `-v` flag
   for long-running operations so these should be able to default to a
   higher verbosity level.
   
   To counter that, there is a new `--no-verbose` flag to turn that off.
 - <csr-id-aeb4a1d5cb76316058c7d687e26f5c7db351c09c/> add `--strict` option to enforce strict checking of configuration.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-49f39d6bb487c0254176a5082f2c7851b83952a1/> `open::ReplacementObjects` is removed in favor of two custom git-configuration flags.
   Now it's possible to map the environment variables `GIT_REPLACE_REF_BASE` and `GIT_NO_REPLACE_OBJECTS`
   to custom git configuration keys which can also be set, namely `gitoxide.odb.replaceObjectsRefBase`
   and `gitoxide.odb.noReplaceObjects`.
   
   Along with the possibility of disabling the usage of `GIT_` prefixed environment variables one
   reaches the previous level of control without making object replacement a special case.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-becbd8d896a1663f1607be4e86e632773e926f1f/> represent object cache configuration like `GITOXIDE_PACK_CACHE_MEMORY` in git-configuration.
   That way there is a unified system for how to set values, which may be overridable by configuration
   variables or not.
   
   With this changes, the explicit application of environment variables for setting the cache
   isn't required anymore as everything happens using git-configuration, and automatically,
   while providing full control like before.

## 0.17.0 (2022-11-06)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-e973dfeaf17ca63385496202e9fdcdd912e20f42/> `gix remote ref-map --show-unmapped-remote-refs`.
   That way it's more obvious to see what was filtered out by ref-specs.
   
   It's also great to validate that server-side filtering via ref-prefix
   will not send refs that are referred to by symbolic refs that are
   not filtered out. That should be fine as it's all about objects,
   it's just something to deal with as we may have to deal with symbolic
   refs that aren't in the set of refs the server sent to us.
 - <csr-id-b1edb9e3537df86669714f03666f4a88e0ac3709/> diff algorithm is controlled by git configuration `diff.algorithm`
 - <csr-id-20259da4ddf9fabfb2d2bd4e2274c0ed42bdb0e5/> `ein t hours` allows to specify the amount of worker threads.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-3a053284cfefe27873dcc5b4f74d63a560bb5d41/> collect `stderr` and print it afterwards to avoid intersection with line progress.
   Previously it would happen that stderr would be printed directly and mix
   with the line progress (as in `-v`) which also prints to stderr.
   
   Now errors are collected and output at the end once the line renderer
   was already shutdown.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3a0fb1b45c757add49677450836c0aaf6179a2b5/> remote `lock_mode` from all methods dealing with reference edits.
   It is now read from `core.filesRefLockTimeout` accordingly.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-92bbe335688e4c8e96061663e71a599022f7b96f/> remove `gix remote --url` in favor of determining the intention similar to `git fetch`

## 0.16.0 (2022-09-20)

### Changed

 - <csr-id-3c7c9a735f5771ef787cbc86b46cbafc9226f4d6/> `ein tool hours -s` was split into `-f|--file-stats` and `-l|line-stats`.
   That way more information is generated at increasingly high costs.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-28c4cae70aab2bd5b479961fcc6ee91ff80f651b/> `ein tool hours --stat` to collect additional statistics per author.
   Note that these are expensive and unconditionally use threads to speed
   up these computations.
 - <csr-id-5d0332f51c63c5456a28c8f3f466ad805b2e0626/> `ein tool hours -b` ignores bots.
   For now it only considers bots with names containing `[bot]`.

## 0.15.0 (2022-08-24)

<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes

### New Features

 - <csr-id-45a30f0f31a99cda5cf105408e9c3905f43071f2/> Support for `-c/--config` in `gix`
 - <csr-id-5d6d5ca305615568dfedbcc10ea86294c0a0472d/> `gix remote refs` to list all remote references of a suitable remote.
   This takes into account either a named remote, or the remote associated
   with the current branch, or the default remote it could deduce or obtain
   from the configuration.
 - <csr-id-b1c40b0364ef092cd52d03b34f491b254816b18d/> use docsrs feature in code to show what is feature-gated automatically on docs.rs

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-dda995790c260131048484a11e66185b9c841311/> remove `gix free remote ref-list` in favor of `gix remote refs`
   The functinality is the same, but the latter is built on top of a
   repository which is slightly less flexible, but preferable over
   maintaining a non-repo version.

### Commit Details

<details><summary>view details</summary>

 * **[#298](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/issues/298)**
    - Use all tags by default, instead of requiring annotated tags ([`00c42ca`](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/commit/00c42ca36e93a22f233fc1d3f9a1afc241fd4464))
    - support for the --max-candidates flag ([`b9e6754`](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/commit/b9e67540801f2630be8aa1acbfddfec4202360ac))
    - Reduce amount of max candidates, add --debug flag ([`c8c13e3`](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/commit/c8c13e398671a21e96282547fc0e3bd445627e2f))

</details>

## 0.11.0 (2022-04-03)

<csr-id-4d2d433e7e98ac42db858688edac06e68ee4d10d/>

Adapt to changes in `git-features` which change `Send + Sync` to `Send + Clone`. This happens to allow non-sync implementations (i.e. thread-local), along with `Sync` ones
which usually are `Clone` too as they are passed by immutable reference (which is `Clone + Copy`).

### Refactor (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-4d2d433e7e98ac42db858688edac06e68ee4d10d/> Remove light* features, add 'lean-async' in its place; remove termion support

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-bf04644ab75ed1969507f957dc8d4868790d462d/> remove `Option<impl Progress>` in favor of `impl Progress`
 - <csr-id-d851bede97801096d188ff6af06c98a79fe276db/> remove unnecessary `Arc` around `should_interrupt` flag
 - <csr-id-c2679a03358b9c19d63ed1af1cd57324c6381447/> remove Sha1 mentions in `index::verify::Mode::*` variants
   The hash is repository defined and not hard-coded
 - <csr-id-51bf03feaa94bebb26690dff92262b2134070a44/> Remove lean plumbing CLI

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-57ca0456cf02073099bfd403f9155290af756ecd/> Collect all stdout messages in line renderer as well
   Otherwise the threaded line renderer will interfere with genuine
   program output.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-384ed665c7423feca1b1ee1f81db10867fa813a8/> `gix mailmap verify` command
 - <csr-id-70109bee679d33a5c5fb3a78a708b479684b03b1/> `ein find --debug` to learn why it is slow
 - <csr-id-00909619ff04e247aabc9ffe3c025f0064c3092d/> --counting-threads flag to configure amount of threads when counting
   The efficiency of multi-threaded counting is low per core, and despite
   some speedups might be desirable, one might not want to commit all cores
   to this amount of waste.
 - <csr-id-25da30f3652bd72c157e84439dd6e3957471fa08/> in-manifest and in-bin documentation of feature toggles
   Unfortunately, these don't show up on docs.rs due to it being a abinary
   only crate. One could consider throwing in a lib just for good measure.

## v0.10.0 (2021-10-20)

This release pins beta versions of `clap` to avoid it to automatically fetch the latest one
during installation.

This is made possible due to `clap` itself pinning its dependency
to the `clap-derive` crate.

## v0.9.0 (2021-10-15)

A first usable version of `git-repository` to make using `gitoxide` from your applications so much easier. It serves as a one-stop shop for application developers without sacrificing performance by default while making common use-cases more convenient.

### Feature list

* `git-repository` as hub crate for application development with focus on usability without sacrificing any knob to tune performance.
* opt-in `async` for `git-packetline`, `git-transport` and `git-protocol` for fully async git clients, along with the `light-async` feature toggle to build a `gix pack-receive` with an async client instead of a blocking one.
* Statistics for `gix pack-create` with the `-s/--statistics` flag to have data indicating the cost of the operation. Currently it's doing a lot of work that has to be avoided in order to be useable in production and the numbers underline that. Future iterations will cause key metrics to go down.
* Packs are now reproducible by default, which means that the same tip will always generate a pack with the same hash. This may be a desirable property for some kinds of packs, but not for others which is why it can be turned off for a considerable speed boost.
* `git-tempfile` crate
* `git-lock` crate
* `git-ref` crate with complete loose-ref, packed-ref and transaction support.


### Performance

* On M1, thanks to [a new release](https://github.com/RustCrypto/hashes/pull/289#event-5035369215), Sha1 is now computed much faster which unlocks a massive performance boost. In my test, verifying/decoding the entire linux kernel pack now happens in 17s, as compared to 37s for canonical `git`.
* `git-object` parsing is a few percent faster thanks a reworked error handling for objects. By default, error collection is disabled entirely making the error case zero-sized. If needed, verbose and stacked errors can be turned on using a feature toggle for applications who expect repositories with malformed objects and need detailed diagnostics.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-60c9fad8002b4e3f6b9607bba6361871752f4d3d/> control pack and object cache size in megabytes in some sub-commands

### Thanks Clippy

<csr-read-only-do-not-edit/>

[Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) helped 3 times to make code idiomatic. 

## v0.6.0 (2020-12-16)

Maintenance release without any new features.

These are created to account for breaking changes within the dependency graph of
`gitoxide` crates. Due to some blunders in the past the version on crates.io
could not be installed anymore.
This was eventually fixed with new minor releases across the ecosystem.

Finally, yet another breaking change due to the introduction of the `git-hash`
crate to break a dependency cycle between `git-object` and `git-features` caused
yet another maintenance release.

## v0.5.0 (2020-12-15)

Maintenance release without any new features.
